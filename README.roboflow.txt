The dataset includes 3577 images.
Dog-poop are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 448x448 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 11 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -11 and +11 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -6 and +6 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
